# AI and Machine Learning

Artificial intelligence has the potential to be an incredible game-changer for Tech4Good challenges. The ecosystem of challenging Tech4Good areas often include many systems, lots of data (though not all of it quality), complex inter-dependencies, and an ability to recognize patterns, which are perfect ingredients for AI and machine learning approaches, when done well.
Although this area is in its infancy, there is a lot of promise around technologies that help to communicate (chatbots), identify anomalous data (corruption, missing data), and coordination (recommender systems, matching algorithms).

## Potential Applications

- Automate tasks, improve feedback, identify patterns in all areas.
- Use predictive models to gather evidence to increase social impact.

- Use big data to unlock existing datasets of unstructured or qualitative data.

## Considerations

The list of considerations to take into account when thinking through AI and machine learning is nearly as long if not longer than the advantages â€” at this point anyway. Risks include data responsibility and ethics, bias (in models, data, and interpretations), costs and sustainability, finding the right expertise, and transparency and accountability, just to name a few.
