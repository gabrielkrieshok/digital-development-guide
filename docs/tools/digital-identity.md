# Digital Identity

It can be easy to take for granted things like a driver’s license, passport, or even a library card with a photo ID. Many in the global south lack an official identity record, and as such makes it harder to register for government services,  and to be counted in official statistics (which, in being counted, makes it easier to advocate for a greater voice in policy discussions). Many organizations across a range of non-profits, start-ups, and international groups are working to find both traditional and innovative ways to bring identity services and recognition to everyone.

## Potential Applications

- Access to health, banking and educational services.
- Help refugees and displaced populations to access immediate and longer-term services.
- Use digital ID as a baseline for cross-sector interventions and support in agriculture, entrepreneurship, and cash remittances.

## Considerations

It is unfair to say that if you don’t have a digital ID, then you simply fail to count, or that you simply don’t exist. Starting from a “digital ID first” orientation can be starting with the solution looking for a problem, rather than the inverse. Digital ID projects are challenging in that they require often significant levels of infrastructure to achieve, which require multilateral stakeholders representing a variety of voices, which are hard to coordinate. Additionally, digital ID projects are susceptible to bias, data leaks, issues of consent and ownership, and transparency and accountability.
