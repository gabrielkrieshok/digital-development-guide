# GIS and Mapping

Maps are used by individuals, organizations, and governments to build models, tell stories, and communicate about the world and what’s happening around it. Understanding and analyzing geospatial data and maps lead to a more holistic view of the world around us, our projects, and our efforts that help us to assess, report, and improve our impact as development organizations. Maps are a ubiquitous tool in the Tech4Good toolset, and goes far beyond Tech4Good itself.

## Potential Applications

- Record geospatial data associated with field surveys and project activities.
- Use maps as a reporting feature as part of any project.
- Use maps to address critical outbreaks, natural disasters, distribution of aid, intersections of civil society and humanitarian issues, and more.

## Considerations

Creating useful maps from your data can be challenging, though is getting easier all the time with better tools and software. Another challenge is both that maps can be easily deceiving in that by their nature they conceal some aspects of the data to illuminate others, intentionally or unintentionally, and that actually reading maps and data well requires its own skill set that is not obvious or innate at the individual or organizational level.
