# Monitoring & Evaluation

Projects and programs use data to understand how well their projects are working — and Tech4Good tools such as data collection, aggregation, analysis, and reporting are the means to that end. Much of the Tech4Good technology space can be overlapped with the monitoring & evaluation (M&E) technology space.

## Potential Applications

- Enhance programs through data-driven decision-making, analysis, and reporting.
- Collect the right data to quickly learn about project performance, and adjust accordingly.
- Use evaluation to better understand the impact of a particular project.

## Considerations

Tech4Good and M&E share a lot of DNA, but they are not interchangeable. It’s not enough to simply have the right tools at hand, but to also have the experience and knowledge base to know how to use them, and critically, where they fall short. As with most areas of Tech4Good, there is no single magic bullet software solution or platform that solves all of these challenges, so knowing where to invest time and energy is often the biggest barrier to effectively using M&E.
