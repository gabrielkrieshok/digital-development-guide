# Data Science

Data science is a more recent addition to the Tech4Good toolset, as our ability to collect, process, and learn from data has grown. Data science is focused on identifying relevant questions, collecting data from a multitude of sources, organizing the information, translating results into solutions, and communicating their findings in a way that will have an impact. The most common areas of data science practice revolve around manipulating and understanding the building blocks of data collection, analysis, reporting, modeling, interpretation, insights, decision-making, and more.

## Potential Applications

- Use data systems to design more effective and efficient services, achieve better outcomes, and deliver greater impact.
- Use open data to transform organizations, communities, and services with existing and public resources.
- Use data architecture to do more with less — collect less data, ensure privacy, provide useful results, and improve feedback cycles.

## Considerations

Benefiting from data science is more than just scraping websites. Organizations and individuals are learning that having the right skills to understand the data they’re working with (as well as its limitations) is critical to their projects. The intersections of data quality, bias, privacy, interpretability, and cost-effectiveness make it daunting. It’s always important to remember the adage from George Box, “all models are wrong, but some are useful.”
