# Data Collection

Data collection is one of the most common concrete Tech4Good activities, and there are many technologies, organizations, and professionals with deep and varied experience in all forms of data collection. Data collection cuts across so many aspects of Tech4Good projects as well, from monitoring project activities to registering new users to surveying beneficiaries to collecting soil samples — it’s data collection all of the way down! Despite its ubiquity, data collection is still a key transformation area and no one is doing it 100% “correctly” — so there are many opportunities for improvement.

## Potential Applications

- Collect routine data on a project’s ongoing activities and performance.
- Use surveys to track long-term trends as well as real-time feedback.
- Use data collection to make more informed decisions around organization priorities, assumptions, and impact.

## Considerations

The challenges in data collection abound — scope, time, cost, quality, human resources, communication, platforms, privacy, ethics, informed consent, and many more. It’s deceptively simple to get started with data collection, and incredibly challenging to get it “right.” Two challenges with the collection process itself that crop up — collecting too much data, and not collecting with sharing results in mind.
