# Design

“Design“ isn’t limited to graphics or web development, but encompasses the way that products and services are interpreted, used, and valued. Approaching Tech4Good challenges through a design lens allows you to make sure you’re solving the right problem, that you have the right people at the table considering the problem and its solutions, and that you’re always incorporating the end-product into your development considerations, whether through a formal“design-thinking“ or“creative-capacity-building“ session, or simply through co-creation workshops with the community on how to actually address behavior change.

## Potential applications

- Use participatory approaches like design thinking to problem-solving for a particular challenge or issue.
- Amplify marketing efforts through print, web, interactive, video, and planning/strategy services.
- Use creative services to build high-quality products and services.

## Considerations

“Design” can be daunting — and is often thought of as icing on the cake for projects — a nice to have, but not critical. Some organizations even go so far as to eschew good design as inherently flashy or at odds with a “for good” down-to-earth brand. Bad design is only polish, whereas good design is better products, better services, better reputations, better communications, and greater impact.
