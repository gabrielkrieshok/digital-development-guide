# Mobile Services

Mobile phones are often used as the starting point for discussions around Tech4Good projects — and for good reason. Mobile phone network expansion and affordable handheld devices means that over half the world has access to a mobile phone, opening up the possibilities for communications, knowledge-sharing, access to important services like financial, government, emergency, and workforce opportunities.

## Potential Applications

- Use phones to give people the right information at the right time in order to act on it.
- Use mobile financial services for greater access to financial markets and inclusion.
- Use mobile service to increase access to and availability of communication.

## Considerations

Assumptions of connectivity via mobile phones is also where Tech4Good plays an important advocacy role. It is not always a given that people will have smartphones — much less a phone, much less connectivity, much less affordable connectivity, etc.. Access is on a spectrum, and this digital divide between the “haves“ and “have nots“ in the digital world need to be designed with everyone in mind.
