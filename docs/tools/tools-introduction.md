# Introduction

This section gives a brief overview of some of the more common areas where you see Tech4Good being applied, particularly in the global development sector.

It’s one thing to look at “technology“ at an abstract level, and to consider how and where to look for best practices, methodologies, and approaches to interventions — and a completely separate issue to look at the specific tool areas where you’re actually going to be doing the work.

For this section in particular, there is a lot of subjective bias, as these are the documents that have been most helpful in the narrow window of projects that I’ve been a part of.
