# Media & Communications

Tech4Good is almost synonymous with media & communications — it’s about using the tools that we already have available to us to focus on a specifically positive social or economic outcome. Tech4Good can be applied to media & communications as a way to amplify voice, facilitate meaningful participation, and foster social change. Communications specifically can include institutional communications (transparency, reporting, public relations) and communications for development (interpersonal communications, community media).

## Potential Applications

- Amplify the reach of projects to more people and communities.
- Develop simple and low-cost ways to exchange ideas, updates, questions.
- Use digital photography and video to help an organization’s communications and outreach.

## Considerations

While developing polished and engaging materials for potential donors to understand the project and want to get involved, it can often seem like an ancillary role of the organization to invest in such activities. As with many areas of Tech4Good challenges, media & communications can be a sprawling area of possibilities, and it’s not clear which efforts to focus on at the expense of attention on other pressing problems.
