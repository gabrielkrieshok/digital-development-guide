# Humanitarian Response

Tech4Good can be critical in improving the quality of humanitarian response overall — and specifically in increasing efficiencies and reducing risk, in enabling local community participation and decision-making, in scaling workable solutions, and in improving outcomes.

## Potential Applications

- Use GIS and mapping to combine data to more effectively identify vulnerable groups.
- Facilitate rapid communication rollouts with mobile services, SMS, coordinated telecommunications infrastructure and operations planning.
- Use secure data collection to record citizen observations such as voting abnormalities, corruption and human trafficking.

## Considerations

Humanitarian crises require learning, adaptation, and innovation. Acute challenges of natural disasters, civil strife, or political turmoil become more pronounced in areas already experiencing poverty, climate change, poor governance, conflict, and food insecurity — and often in unpredictable and challenging ways.
