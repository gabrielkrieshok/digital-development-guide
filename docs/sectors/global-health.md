# Global Health

There are many instances of ICTs being leveraged well (and many poorly) across global health efforts. Global health refers to the collection of domains of study, research, and practice that address improving health and achieving health equity for people around the world. Within this scope, there are many examples of ICT driving health projects, including healthcare services, demography, public health initiatives, service delivery, disaster response, record-keeping, supply chains, communications, and the list goes on.

## Potential Applications

- Use ICTs to improve health information systems at local, sub-national, national, and regional levels.
- Improve health care services and disease prevention with ICTs through better access, more services, and tailored services.

## Considerations

Applying ICTs to global health challenges is far from easy. The environments where interventions occur are often complex, complicated, wicked (in the “wicked problems” sense), inter-connected challenges where a technology-based “solution” has to be incredibly well thought-out and executed in delivery — from data collection that ensures patient privacy to record-keeping that maintains integrity across platforms to behavior-change campaigns that push the right (and actionable) messaging, to many more. It’s one of the more challenging areas to leverage ICT, and for the critical role of global health in the world, also one of the most important.
