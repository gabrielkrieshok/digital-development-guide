# Introduction

This section provides a base understanding of the sectors where you often see applied to Tech4Good being applied.

For example, you can see how the broad area of “education“ as a sector will have organizations using tools in data science, GIS and mapping, and data visualization to suit their needs.

Note also however, that these sectors don’t have clearly defined and well-mapped tool areas, or vice versa. Every example of Tech4Good in the real world is a complex stew of these ingredients, and assembled according to the specific environment (when they work well, that is!)
