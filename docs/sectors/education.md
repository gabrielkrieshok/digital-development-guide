# Education

Tech4Good in education helps with access to educational services, improves teacher capacity to deliver those services, and strengthens the education system capacity. Education in the Tech4Good space also refers to addressing digital literacy specifically — familiarity with digital tools and services, computer, web, and mobile tools, and how to perform basic technology-based tasks.

## Potential Applications

- Teachers using computers in the classroom.
- Teacher training on computer skills, and educational and productivity software.
- Camps, clubs, and conferences targeting educational Tech4Good efforts.

## Considerations

It’s not enough to simply have access to computers in the classroom or for students to have mobile phones or computer labs. Technology is so pervasive in modern life, and our current global education systems are the initial splitting we see with the digital divide — those with access have further access to educational materials, support, and mentorship, whereas those without access can find themselves quickly left behind.
