# Tech4Good Resources

This section is a compilation of many of the best organizations, platforms, resources, services, and links to useful information that I’ve found over the years.

Some of these resources are difficult to narrowly categorize, and often serve multiple areas (for example, is a useful health data repository part of global health or part of a broader dataset platform.)

I’ve also prioritized resources that have been around for a few years, or that seem particularly solid and with a strong reputation, as new areas, organizations, and resources are being created all of the time.

All of these resources can also be found online in [an easy-to-read table](https://tech4goodguide.org/resources/).
