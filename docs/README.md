# About

This **ICT4D Guide** is a free and open guide to help anyone who wants to make a positive social impact with technology's help.

**Who this Guide is for**

The Guide should help you if you work in a social non-profit, international development, community organizing, entrepreneurship, civil society development, and more.

This Guide should have useful information for you whether you're starting your career in the social sector and have a knack for working in technology, or a seasoned tech expert who's been working in this space for 30 years, or if you're in the commercial tech sector and are thinking of transitioning to doing tech for good in the social sector.

**Acknowledgments**

This effort could not have been carried out alone, and I would like to thank the efforts of the experts who contributed so kindly --- **Gina Assaf**, **Sarah Kozyn**, **Matt Haikin**, **Sandra Gubler**, and **Nick Martin**.

Additionally, I'd like to thank the folks who helped on the earlier versions of the ICT4DGuide from **Henry Bruce**, **Annie Legge**, **Josh Zamor**, and **Derek Caelin**.

### Guide Background

I began writing this guide as a simple way to organize my own resources along the way in my fieldwork.

I wanted to use the opportunity of making this resource more public as a way to extend that reach even further.

Additionally, I'm hoping to learn from those who read it to provide feedback so that I can learn even more along the way.

If we have been successful, we will play a part in 'more evenly distributing the future' among the present.
