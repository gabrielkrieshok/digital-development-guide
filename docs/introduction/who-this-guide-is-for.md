# Who this Guide is for

The Guide should help you if you work in a social non-profit, international development, community organizing, entrepreneurship, civil society development, and more.

This Guide should have useful information for you whether you’re starting your career in the social sector and have a knack for working in technology, or a seasoned tech expert who’s been working in this space for 30 years, or if you’re in the commercial tech sector and are thinking of transitioning to doing tech for good in the social sector.
