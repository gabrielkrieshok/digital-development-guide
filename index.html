		<h3 class="title">About the Tech4Good Field Guide</h3>
		<p>The Tech4Good Field Guide is a collection of resources — organizations, products, services, platforms, and publications that are useful to anyone using technology to make a positive impact.</p>
		<p>The Field Guide should help you if you work in a social non-profit, international development, community organizing, entrepreneurship, civil society development, and more.</p>
		<p>This Guide should have useful information for you whether you’re starting your career in the social sector and have a knack for working in technology, or a seasoned tech expert who’s been working in this space for 30 years, or if you’re in the commercial tech sector and are thinking of transitioning to doing tech for good in the social sector.</p>
		<p>This Field Guide came out of my own years of experience working at the intersection of technology and social development, primarily working in global environments and contexts. I found myself hoping that there was a collection of these resources, ideas, and assistance that I could reference as I went along in my own journey. Finding none that fit exactly what I needed, I decided to compile my findings as I went.</p>
		<hr>

		<p style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: 900;">I'm offering the Tech4Good Guide for a limited time as a free PDF download.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: 900;">I'd love to hear any/all feedback!</p>

	<p>Finally, this effort could not have been carried out alone, and I would like to thank the efforts of the experts who contributed so kindly — <strong>Gina Assaf</strong>, <strong>Sarah Kozyn</strong>, <strong>Matt Haikin</strong>, <strong>Sandra Gubler</strong>, and <strong>Nick Martin</strong>.
		Additionally, I’d like to thank the folks who helped on the earlier versions of the ICT4DGuide from <strong>Henry Bruce</strong>, <strong>Annie Legge</strong>, and <strong>Derek Caelin</strong>.
