# Design thinking

ICT4D practitioners use design thinking and creative capacity-building (CCB) to respond to the challenges of their host communities and counterparts.

Field staff are optimally placed to work with their community to arrive at new and different ways of doing things, of addressing long-standing challenges, and in finding ways to change behavior, thought, and action in their environments.



## Ideas

- Using design thinking and creative capacity building (CCB) to supplement participatory approaches to problem-solving.
- Investigate the needs, context, and assets of their environment and use cooperative problem-solving to build towards sustainable solutions.
