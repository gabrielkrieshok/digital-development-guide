# Open Tech4Good

This **Open Tech4Good** guide is an open guide to help anyone who wants to make a positive social impact with technology's help.

Browse the Guide online here (optimized for mobile and as a [Progressive Web App](https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/) as well), and contribute changes via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/gabrielkrieshok/tech4good-guide/issues). I also maintain an [AirTable listing](https://gabrielkrieshok.com/resources/) of all the up-to-date resources as well.

Recently, I [wrote a book](https://www.amazon.com/Gabriel-Krieshok/e/B07RTRKY9V/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_1) which incorporates many of these resources, as well as additional history, context, and how-tos for using Tech4Good resources. [Check it out](http://tech4goodguide.org/) â€” available for download as a PDF or for [purchase from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Gabriel-Krieshok/e/B07RTRKY9V/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_1).
